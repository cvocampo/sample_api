# Library used

Laravel sanctum for authentication = https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/sanctum.
Spatie Roles and Permissions for handling the roles efficiently = https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-permission/v4/introduction.


# Setting up Database

Use mysql with phpmyadmin, then create a database named laravel_api


# Email

Kindly put email configuration for email, i used mailtrap.io for this project so you can test the email functionality.


# Endpoints with Authentication

when using postman, these are the endpoints with token (from the sanctum login)

> /logout
> /invite
> /update

you can futhermore check the endpoints to api.php


If you have more question just email me. I hope we can start working together!
